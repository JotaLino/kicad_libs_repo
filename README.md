Kicad Libraries - 2019-12-11

This repository aims to contribute with missing component libraries that I need to create for my own work and thus make them available to everyone.
Some libraries will be placed here, even for existing ones, either because they contain errors or because they are improperly designed for a cleaner schematic.
Libraries will be one for each component so that they can be integrated manually and each component will be at least 3 files: part_name.lib, part_name.dcm, part_name.kicad_mod and eventually part_name.stp/wrl (3d model).
